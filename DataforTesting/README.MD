*** Prepare generated datasets for multiple parties ***
1. Generated_Datasets: 
    - All of them have personal identifiable features (house number, zip code, date of birth and sex)
    - Except personal identifiers, all of them have 20 generated variables + one target variable
    - Datasets were generated by a linear model (all features have linear relation with target variable)
    - There are 5 different sizes of datasets (csv): 5000, 10000, 30000, 50000,  and 100000 records 

2. input.json: 
    - input the number of data partitions (data parties)
    - input the datasets you want to use

3. SplitDatasets.py
    - once you complete the input.json, go to the directory in the terminal and run:
    - "python SplitDataset.py" 

**How to use?**

1. In your terminal:

```powershell
docker pull sophia921025/datasharing_gendata:v0.1
```

2. Configure ***input.json***

3. Run docker container, for Mac/Linux users:

```powershell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" sophia921025/datasharing_gendata:v0.1
```

For Windows users:

```powershell
docker run --rm -v "%cd%/output:/output" sophia921025/datasharing_gendata:v0.1
```

4. You will find splited generated data files in the output folder.
